# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Description

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my profile, education, skills, projects, and achievements.  
NOTE: Both Vercel and Netlify links are provided here. However, Vercel sometimes has issues loading large-size data properly. For a smoother and clearer viewing experience, it is recommended to use the Netlify link.

netlify hosting: https://myself-shovo-kumar.netlify.app/  (✔️✔️ Recomended for proper and smooth view)
vercel hosting: https://myself-shovo-kumar-acharjo.vercel.app/  ( may be laggy or get error for huge data )

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- GitHub (version control)  
- Vercel (deployment & hosting)  
- Netlify (for proper deployment and hosting; works perfectly compared to Vercel)
